GC_soil_T_obs_scale_0.60 is same as GC_soil_T_obs, but N_avail x E is scaled by 0.6.

GC_soil_T_obs_fit_18_degree is similar to GC_soil_T_obs, but the make the new temp dependence equals the old at 18.0 Celsius degree.

GC_soil_T_obs_fit_OMI_NO2 use the temp dependence from fitting OMI NO2.


all_scale means scale temperature function rather than N_avail x E
